**A local-first QA skill for AI-generated PRs. CodeWard turns a PR diff into affected flows, missing evidence, and E2E drafts. No cloud. No LLM token.**

CodeWard is a local-first CLI that reads git changes, project structure, runner signals, selectors, and optional repo QA memory, then returns a PR-ready QA draft: which user flow may be affected, which runner fits, what E2E or checklist should exist, and what evidence is still missing before merge.

It is built for the moment when a reviewer asks: "This PR looks plausible, but which user flow could it break, and what should we test before merge?"

CodeWard does not call an LLM API, upload source code, or require a service account. It runs in the repository you already have.

The core loop is intentionally simple:

```txt
PR diff
  -> codeward qa

CodeWard output
  -> PR comment draft + E2E/checklist draft + missing evidence

Optional team memory
  -> .codeward/manifest.yaml
  -> better future PR recommendations
```

## Install & Quick Start

Requires Node.js 20 or newer.

Run CodeWard once without adding a dependency:

```sh
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

That first command is intentionally manifest-free. It previews a PR comment/checklist that names the affected flow, recommended runner, draft file, missing fixture/selector/assertion evidence, and validation command.

Install CodeWard in a repository when you want a repeatable project command:

```sh
pnpm add -D @ivorycanvas/codeward
pnpm exec codeward qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

Generate a Markdown artifact that an agent or reviewer can paste into a PR:

```sh
pnpm exec codeward qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD --output CODEWARD_QA.md
```

When you are ready to create actual draft test files instead of a PR comment preview:

```sh
pnpm exec codeward e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD --dry-run
pnpm exec codeward e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

Optional accuracy upgrade: create repo-local QA memory from the default branch, review it, then let future PRs reuse it:

```sh
git switch main
pnpm exec codeward manifest context .
pnpm exec codeward manifest init .
git add .codeward/manifest.yaml
git commit -m "Add CodeWard verification manifest"
```

Preview adoption without writing a manifest into the target repository:

```sh
pnpm exec codeward manifest init . --write /tmp/codeward-manifest.yaml
pnpm exec codeward qa . --manifest /tmp/codeward-manifest.yaml --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

Use the lower-level scanner when you want repository guardrail findings:

```sh
pnpm exec codeward scan .
```

## 30-Second PR Demo

Preview the PR QA comment/checklist CodeWard would generate for the current branch:

```sh
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

![CodeWard 30-second PR demo](docs/assets/codeward-30s-demo.gif)

In this demo, CodeWard maps a checkout form PR to the `Checkout purchase` flow, previews `tests/e2e/checkout-purchase.spec.ts`, and names the missing evidence before that draft can be trusted. It does **not** claim browser QA has passed; it also names the remaining work, such as deterministic fixture data and a real `pnpm run test:e2e` execution.

CodeWard reads the changed files and project signals:

```txt
Input
- git diff: origin/main...HEAD
- project structure: package.json, routes, test config, selectors
- optional team context: .codeward/manifest.yaml, CONTEXT.md, ADRs, goals, QA runbooks
```

Then it returns reviewable verification work:

```txt
Output
- PR comment/checklist draft for this branch
- changed domain language and candidate user flows
- recommended E2E runner or manual checklist
- draft Playwright, Maestro, CLI, API, or manual test files
- readiness status: runnable-candidate, near-runnable, or review-only
- blockers such as missing runner config, selectors, fixtures, or assertions
```

Example `codeward qa` output for a small Next.js checkout form change:

```txt
# CodeWard QA Draft

Summary
- Project: Web
- Recommended runner: Playwright
- Manifest: .codeward/manifest.yaml
- Readiness: near-runnable

PR Comment Draft
- Affected flow: Checkout purchase
- Suggested draft: tests/e2e/checkout-purchase.spec.ts
- Changed files: src/app/checkout/page.tsx, src/features/checkout/CheckoutForm.tsx
- Success signal: confirmation state is visible after submit
- If wrong: update .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.checkout-checkout-purchase.anchors

Missing evidence before trusting this PR
- [required] fixture: Add deterministic payment/customer fixture data.
- [recommended] selector: Confirm stable selectors for changed checkout controls.

PR checklist
- [ ] Review tests/e2e/checkout-purchase.spec.ts.
- [ ] Confirm the checkout success and failed-response assertions.
- [ ] Run pnpm run test:e2e.
```

The generated draft reads like the user journey instead of a generic file checklist:

```ts
test("Checkout purchase", async ({ page }) => {
  // Verification manifest evidence:
  // Flow: Checkout Purchase
  // .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.checkout-checkout-purchase.anchors

  await test.step("Open route /checkout.", async () => {
    await page.goto("/checkout");
  });

  await test.step("Fill checkout email.", async () => {
    await page.getByPlaceholder("Email").fill("buyer@example.com");
  });

  await test.step("Submit checkout.", async () => {
    await page.getByTestId("checkout-submit").click();
  });

  await expect(page.getByText("Order confirmed")).toBeVisible();
});
```

See [docs/quickstart-demo.md](docs/quickstart-demo.md) for a compact walkthrough, [docs/agent-skill.md](docs/agent-skill.md) for agent handoff usage, [docs/manifest.md](docs/manifest.md) for the verification manifest loop, and [docs/e2e-output-examples.md](docs/e2e-output-examples.md) for more output shapes.

CodeWard also ships a portable agent skill template at [skills/codeward-pr-qa/SKILL.md](skills/codeward-pr-qa/SKILL.md). Use it with any local agent workflow that can read reusable instructions before finalizing a PR.

## Why This Is Different

Recorders such as browser or mobile test studios are useful when you already know the flow to exercise. CodeWard starts one step earlier: it asks what the PR changed, which repo-owned QA memory applies, and what test artifact should exist before merge.

A good CodeWard result should answer:

- which product flow changed
- which manifest domain, flow, and checks caused the recommendation
- which draft test file was generated or previewed
- which success, failure, edge, contract, or visual cases the draft covers
- which selector, fixture, auth, runner, or validation gaps still block trusted regression evidence
- which manifest path to edit when the recommendation is wrong

That is the product bet: one human correction to the repo-local manifest should improve future PR recommendations without another LLM prompt.

You do not need a manifest to start. Without one, CodeWard uses the PR diff, package signals, routes, selectors, runner config, and existing tests. Add a manifest only when the team wants durable QA language that improves future recommendations.

## What CodeWard Is For

CodeWard is intentionally small:

- time-saving: it surfaces missing context, risky settings, and validation gaps before agent work becomes review churn
- static by default: it does not execute scanned project code
- no-token by default: it does not call an LLM API
- verification-focused: it tells reviewers what evidence is missing, not how to style code
- PR QA skill output: `codeward qa` turns a branch into a PR-ready affected-flow summary, suggested E2E/checklist draft, missing evidence list, and copyable checklist
- packaged agent skill: `skills/codeward-pr-qa/SKILL.md` gives coding agents a compact PR QA workflow for running CodeWard before handoff
- domain-aware E2E drafting: it turns branch changes into flow language, draft specs, readiness summaries, and action items
- repo-local verification base: shared manifests can be committed, while generated run history stays ignored by default
- context-aware baseline generation: manifest init can use repo-local context, ADRs, goals, agent instructions, harness files, skills, and runbooks as advisory bootstrap signals
- harness/skill role hints: instruction-derived context is classified as agent skill, harness config, workflow lifecycle, verification rubric, safety policy, release policy, or test runner context
- ecosystem-aware: it suggests validation commands for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Gradle, and Maven projects
- CI-friendly: text, JSON, Markdown, and SARIF output are supported
- explainable: every finding includes a concrete fix

It is built for teams using AI coding agents, MCP-powered tools, or any workflow where an agent can read, edit, test, commit, or open pull requests.

For PR verification, CodeWard treats the repository itself as the working base: committed manifests hold durable team language, ignored local history holds generated run observations, and the current branch diff supplies what changed now.

<details>
<summary>한국어 소개</summary>

CodeWard는 AI 코딩 에이전트가 만든 PR을 리뷰하기 전에 로컬에서 실행하는 QA 초안 CLI입니다.

PR diff와 repo 구조를 읽고 어떤 사용자 플로우가 영향받았는지, 어떤 E2E 또는 체크리스트가 필요한지, fixture/selector/assertion/runner/validation 근거 중 무엇이 부족한지 정리합니다. 클라우드나 LLM 토큰을 쓰지 않습니다.

목표는 거대한 QA 플랫폼이 아니라, 유지보수자가 매번 에이전트에게 프로젝트 맥락과 검증 방법을 다시 설명하느라 쓰는 시간을 줄여주는 작고 선명한 도구입니다. Manifest 없이 바로 시작하고, 반복해서 틀리는 추천은 `.codeward/manifest.yaml`에 팀의 QA 언어로 보정해 향후 PR 추천을 개선합니다.

</details>

## Quick Commands

```sh
pnpm exec codeward qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD
pnpm exec codeward qa . --manifest /tmp/codeward-manifest.yaml --base origin/main --head HEAD --output CODEWARD_QA.md
pnpm exec codeward scan .
pnpm exec codeward verify . --base origin/main --head HEAD --pr-body-file pr-body.md
pnpm exec codeward manifest context .
pnpm exec codeward manifest init .
pnpm exec codeward manifest validate .
pnpm exec codeward manifest explain . --base origin/main --head HEAD
pnpm exec codeward e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD --dry-run
```

Use `pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward ...` for one-off runs without installing CodeWard into the target repository.

## Why It Matters

AI agents are becoming normal contributors to software projects. They can research a repository, edit files, run commands, and prepare pull requests. The hidden cost is setup time: maintainers repeatedly explain project rules, safe validation commands, risky files, and review expectations before the useful work can begin.

The risky failure mode is not always broken code. It is code that looks plausible, merged through a repository with missing context, broad permissions, unsafe scripts, or weak validation.

CodeWard gives maintainers a quick first line of defense:

- Is there clear guidance for agents?
- Are MCP configs safe enough to inspect?
- Are committed agent settings or hooks able to run risky commands?
- Are API endpoints documented only in prose, without a machine-readable contract source?
- Did a local `.env` file slip into the repo?
- Can package scripts publish, push, merge, or run risky shell pipelines?
- Are workflows using broad permissions or risky triggers?
- Is there a real test command for agent-made changes?
- Does an AI-assisted change explain its intent, risk, and verification evidence?

For a repository baseline before broad agent use, run:

```sh
codeward scan .
```

```txt
CodeWard 0.1.0
Findings: 6 (high: 3, medium: 2, low: 1, info: 0)

HIGH
- CW003 Suspicious agent instruction text (AGENTS.md)
  Fix: Remove untrusted instruction text or move examples into clearly fenced documentation.
```

When developing CodeWard from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/IvoryCanvas/codeward.git
cd codeward
pnpm install
pnpm build
node dist/cli.js scan /path/to/repo
```

CodeWard `0.2.0` is a local-first PR verification planner with a repository-level verification manifest loop, not a finished automatic QA bot. A good result is a clear answer to "what should this branch prove before merge?", plus manifest-backed E2E, fixture, selector, and validation work that a developer can turn into real regression coverage. Many first drafts will correctly report `review-only` or `near-runnable` until the project adds runner config, stable selectors, deterministic fixtures, or team-owned manifest entries.

## What CodeWard Produces

On a changed branch, CodeWard tries to produce reviewable verification artifacts instead of only saying "write more tests":

- a branch-aware verification plan that names the changed domain, actor, trigger, goal, success signal, and edge cases
- draft Playwright, Maestro, CLI command, or manual checklist files when the repository shape supports them
- a repo-level verification manifest loop where humans correct durable flows once and later PRs get sharper route/check/test draft suggestions
- a runner setup proposal that explains why Playwright or Maestro fits the changed surface and which files/commands would be created if the team accepts it
- readiness evidence that explains missing runner config, selectors, fixture data, assertions, validation commands, or flow manifests
- repo-local suggestions for `.codeward/domains.yml`, `.codeward/flows.yml`, and ignored `.codeward/runs/` history so teams can improve the next run without spending LLM tokens

That means CodeWard is most valuable when it becomes the team's verification base: humans define the durable language and critical flows once, CodeWard reuses that base on each PR, and generated observations stay local unless the team intentionally promotes them into shared policy.

For monorepos, pass `--workspace-root` when scanning a package. Package-local checks still use the package directory, while repo-level guardrails such as `AGENTS.md`, `.github/workflows`, `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` are read from the workspace root.

`codeward review` compares a branch against a base ref for PR-style workflows. It separates newly introduced findings from risky files that already had findings on the base branch but were modified again, which helps reviewers notice when a PR touches known-dangerous surfaces such as committed `.env` files, MCP configs, or release scripts.

`codeward verify` is the easiest PR-facing command. It combines `review`, `test-plan`, and `eval` into one report with review findings, readiness gates, suggested domain tests, suggested commands, and next actions.

`codeward test-plan` turns changed file paths into a review-ready domain test checklist. It also discovers common validation commands from `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, Gradle files, and Maven `pom.xml`. Add `--include-working-tree` for local, uncommitted changes while iterating.

`codeward e2e plan` turns changed file paths into a first-pass E2E testing plan. It detects whether a project looks like Expo/React Native, web, API/service, or CLI package, recommends a runner such as Maestro or Playwright, starts backend services with an API contract checklist, starts executable packages with a CLI command verification checklist, suggests bootstrap steps for repos with little or no test history, suggests domain language for the changed behavior, suggests candidate user flows, adds coverage targets, compares those targets with existing test-suite evidence when tests are present, flags API-dependent flows that need mock or fixture responses, and points out missing stable selectors such as `testID` or `data-testid` before anyone starts writing tests from a blank file.

The plan also includes an execution profile: detected start command, test command, Playwright `baseURL`, mobile app id, runner config files, env fixture files, confidence, and blockers. This keeps generated E2E drafts honest about whether they are runnable candidates or still review-only scaffolds.

When a repository does not already have the selected E2E runner, the plan includes a runner setup proposal instead of silently changing the project. The proposal explains why the runner fits the changed surface, which package command installs the library, which config/script files would be created, and the explicit acceptance command such as `codeward e2e setup . --runner playwright`.

`codeward e2e setup` is the opt-in apply step. For Playwright it can create `playwright.config.ts`, `tests/e2e/`, a `test:e2e` script, and the first changed-flow Playwright spec. For Maestro it can create `.maestro/`, `.maestro/README.md`, a `test:e2e` script, and the first changed-flow YAML draft. Existing draft files are skipped unless `--force` is passed. It does not run package installation automatically; it prints the install command so teams can keep dependency policy under review.

When run at a monorepo root, the E2E plan also reports changed app/package targets. This helps a maintainer move from a broad workspace diff to scoped commands such as `codeward e2e plan services/offer --workspace-root . --base origin/main --head HEAD`, where package-specific runner detection and flow naming are usually sharper.

Each candidate flow also includes a flow language brief: actor, trigger, goal, success signal, reviewer question, and edge cases. The brief keeps generated tests tied to product behavior rather than only changed file names.

The bootstrap section answers what must happen before generated drafts can be treated as real regression coverage. For example, a testless web project can get required steps for Playwright setup, first draft generation, stable selector work, fixture/mock data, and missing validation evidence, plus recommended steps for `.codeward/manifest.yaml`, `.codeward/domains.yml`, `.codeward/flows.yml`, and local history recording.

Run `codeward manifest init .` to create a baseline verification manifest. CodeWard infers domains, flows, route/component anchors, checks, runner hints, source, and confidence from the current checkout.

> **Important:** create the shared team baseline from the repository's default branch, after pulling the latest changes. CodeWard does not silently switch branches or rewrite the repository state, so running `manifest init` from a feature branch creates a feature-branch snapshot, not the team's default QA map.

```sh
git switch main
git pull
codeward manifest context .
codeward manifest init . --write .codeward/manifest.yaml
```

`codeward manifest context .` is a read-only preview of the repo-local knowledge CodeWard can see before writing the manifest. It reports context sources such as `CONTEXT.md`, ADRs, goals, runbooks, agent instructions, harness files, and skills, then shows role classifications, validation commands, safety rules, and diagnostics for stale or missing context.

After the baseline is committed, feature branches should usually run `manifest explain`, `e2e plan`, or `e2e draft` against the PR base such as `origin/main`. The manifest is not meant to be perfect on the first run. It is meant to start the feedback loop: CodeWard recommends E2E work from the manifest, shows why a recommendation happened, and points to the manifest path to edit when the recommendation is wrong.

Generated manifests include a `$schema` reference to `schema/codeward-manifest.schema.json`, so teams can validate and edit `.codeward/manifest.yaml` with a documented contract. See [docs/manifest.md](docs/manifest.md) for the full field guide and adoption workflow.

Use `codeward manifest validate .` before treating the manifest as shared team policy. It reports missing manifests, invalid YAML/schema shape, duplicate ids, missing domain paths, stale anchor files, suspicious route hints, and low-confidence inferred entries that should be reviewed.

Use `codeward manifest explain . --base origin/main --head HEAD` when you want to understand one branch. It reads the git diff, lists the matched manifest domains/flows/checks, shows the declared entry route and required checks, and names the exact manifest path to update if the recommendation is wrong.

When `.codeward/manifest.yaml` exists, `codeward verify`, `codeward e2e plan`, and `codeward e2e draft` include a Manifest Recommendations section:

```txt
Why this was recommended:
- Changed files match anchors for the Campaign Application Complete flow.

Manifest evidence:
- .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.campaign-application-complete.anchors

Next actions:
- Draft or review E2E coverage for the Campaign Application Complete flow.
- Cover the declared checks: Submit content URL successfully; Show validation error for invalid content URL.

If this is wrong:
- Update .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.campaign-application-complete.anchors

Repair hints:
- If these files do not belong to this flow, update .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.campaign-application-complete.anchors.
- If the recommended assertions feel vague, rewrite .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.campaign-application-complete.checks in team language.
```

When a matched manifest flow has an entry route and checks, `codeward e2e draft` promotes it ahead of heuristic candidates. The generated Playwright, Maestro, or manual draft carries the manifest evidence, uses the manifest route as an entrypoint when possible, and turns manifest checks into draft steps and required coverage notes. This is the core cost-saving loop: humans fix durable QA context once, then future PRs start from a stronger draft instead of a blank test file.

The domain language section is intentionally less implementation-oriented than the raw file list. For example, changes under `src/features/in-app-purchase/` become terms such as `In App Purchase` and scenarios such as `In App Purchase primary journey`. When a changed component or service file names a concrete behavior, CodeWard should prefer that behavior before the generic primary journey: `src/features/offer/components/ContentUrlSubmitModal.tsx` can become `Offer Content URL Submit`, and the generated draft file can become `.maestro/offer-content-url-submit.yaml`. When `.codeward/domains.yml` exists, declared product terms and routes receive higher confidence. When `.codeward/flows.yml` exists, team-approved flow names appear as preferred scenario names.

If `.codeward/domains.yml` exists, `codeward e2e plan` also matches changed files against shared product or domain language:

```yaml
domains:
  - id: billing
    name: Billing
    aliases:
      - checkout
      - subscription
    files:
      - src/features/billing/**
    routes:
      - /billing
    scenarios:
      - title: Billing primary journey
        checks:
          - Start from the normal billing entry point.
          - Complete the primary billing action with realistic data.
```

Run `codeward domains init .` to create a starter domain manifest. Run `codeward domains suggest . --base origin/main --head HEAD` when you want CodeWard to draft manifest entries from the current branch and classify each candidate as `commit-candidate`, `needs-review`, or `low-signal`. Use domains for naming and route hints; use core flows when the team wants to define a durable verification journey.

If `.codeward/flows.yml` exists, `codeward e2e plan` also matches changed files against team-approved core flows. This lets maintainers encode the product or domain flows humans already care about:

```yaml
flows:
  - id: checkout-purchase
    name: Checkout purchase
    priority: critical
    domains:
      - checkout
    files:
      - src/pages/checkout/**
      - src/features/checkout/**
    routes:
      - /checkout
    checks:
      - Complete checkout with a valid payment method.
      - Verify declined payment recovery.
```

Run `codeward flows init .` to create a starter manifest. Run `codeward flows suggest . --base origin/main --head HEAD` when you want CodeWard to draft flow entries from changed files, inferred domain language, routes, and E2E checks, then classify which entries are close enough to review as shared policy. Unlike generated run history, `.codeward/flows.yml` is meant to be reviewed and committed when those flow definitions should become team policy.

Pass `--record-history` when you want CodeWard to keep a compact local snapshot of an E2E plan under `.codeward/runs/`. CodeWard automatically protects `.codeward/runs/`, `.codeward/cache/`, `.codeward/tmp/`, and `.codeward/*.local.json` with `.gitignore` so generated history stays local by default. Shared project policy, such as `codeward.config.json`, `.codeward/domains.yml`, and `.codeward/flows.yml`, remains commit-friendly.

`codeward e2e draft --dry-run` previews the same draft analysis without creating directories or files. Use it first when evaluating a new repository or PR. The output still includes planned file paths, self-checks, readiness status, action items, TODO counts, and execution blockers.

`codeward e2e draft` writes draft files from that plan. Expo and React Native projects get Maestro YAML flows under `.maestro/` by default, web projects get Playwright specs under `tests/e2e/`, API/service projects get contract checklist drafts, and CLI packages get command verification checklists until a project-specific runner is documented. For web apps, CodeWard recognizes common Next.js, React Router, Vite, Vue/Nuxt, Svelte, Remix, Astro, and Angular signals. It can infer routes from Next Pages Router files, Next App Router files such as `src/app/(group)/products/[id]/page.tsx`, React Router `path` objects, links, and imperative navigation calls. Drafts infer stable selectors such as `testID`, `accessibilityLabel`, `data-testid`, `aria-label`, placeholder text, role-based buttons or links, and visible text where possible. They also carry fixture/mock readiness notes, inferred API endpoint hints, and Playwright route-fulfillment scaffolds so client flows can be tested with deterministic data before a real server path exists. They keep `TODO` placeholders where selectors, fixtures, assertions, or project-specific launch details are still needed, and existing files are not overwritten unless `--force` is passed.

The draft result is meant to be useful as a PR artifact, not only as generated files. Markdown and JSON output include:

- `languageBrief`: actor, trigger, goal, success signal, reviewer question, and edge cases for each draft file
- `promotionStatus`: whether the draft is a `commit-candidate`, `needs-review`, or `low-signal`
- `runnableStatus`: whether the draft is a `runnable-candidate`, `near-runnable`, or `review-only`
- `selfCheck`: static runner checks for generated draft structure, unresolved placeholders, TODO markers, and the execution profile
- `status`: whether the file was `preview`ed by `--dry-run`, `created`, or `skipped`
- `actionItems`: required and recommended follow-up work, grouped by assertion, fixture, selector, runner, validation, and manifest
- `actionSummary`: total required/recommended action counts, ready file count, and the most common action categories
- `readinessSummary`: an overall 0-100 score, readiness level, self-check counts, TODO counts, execution blocker counts, and top blockers

See [docs/e2e-output-examples.md](docs/e2e-output-examples.md) for compact examples of web, mobile, API/service, CLI, test-light, and monorepo output.

Generated Playwright drafts use the flow language as `test.step()` names so the file reads like the user journey it protects:

```ts
await test.step("Open route /checkout.", async () => {
  await page.goto("/checkout");
});

await test.step("Complete checkout with a valid payment method.", async () => {
  // Step intent: Complete checkout with a valid payment method.
  await page.getByTestId("checkout-submit").click();
});

await test.step("Fill profile email.", async () => {

`codeward history init` prepares that local storage explicitly without running an analysis. It creates `.codeward/runs/`, `.codeward/cache/`, and `.codeward/tmp/`, then adds the generated-history ignore patterns to `.gitignore` idempotently.

`codeward eval` scores whether a branch has enough validation evidence, changed-test coverage, intent capture, risk explanation, domain verification paths, and reviewable size. In GitHub Actions, CodeWard can read the pull request body from the event payload and append the evaluation to the PR comment.

## What It Checks

The first release focuses on high-signal checks that are useful across many repositories.

| Rule | Severity | What it catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CW001` | medium | Missing agent instruction files. |
| `CW002` | medium | Conflicting agent guidance. |
| `CW003` | high | Suspicious instruction text that can misdirect agents. |
| `CW004` | medium/high | Risky MCP command configuration. |
| `CW005` | high | Secret-like values embedded in MCP config. |
| `CW006` | medium | Missing or placeholder test scripts. |
| `CW007` | low | Missing GitHub Actions workflows. |
| `CW008` | high | Committed local environment files. |
| `CW009` | high | Package scripts that can publish, push, merge, or run unsafe shell pipelines. |
| `CW010` | medium | Broad workflow permissions or risky workflow triggers. |
| `CW011` | low | Missing community health files. |
| `CW012` | medium/high | Risky committed agent settings, hooks, or broad shell permissions. |
| `CW013` | low | API endpoints documented only in prose without a contract source. |

## Configuration

Use `codeward.config.json` or `.codeward.json` to tune repository policy.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IvoryCanvas/codeward/main/schema/codeward.schema.json",
  "failOn": "high",
  "ignoreRules": ["CW011"],
  "maxFiles": 2000,
  "validationCommands": ["make test", "make lint"],
  "severity": {
    "CW007": "info"
  }
}
```

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for details.

## GitHub Actions

CodeWard can run as a lightweight PR check with annotations, a step summary, and a sticky PR comment:

```yaml
name: CodeWard

on:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  codeward:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: IvoryCanvas/codeward@main
        with:
          mode: review
          base: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
          head: HEAD
          fail-on: high
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The PR comment can include suggested domain tests and a verification readiness evaluation for changed files. For rollout guidance, see [docs/adoption.md](docs/adoption.md) and [docs/github-action.md](docs/github-action.md).

## Where CodeWard Fits

CodeWard is not trying to replace the larger security ecosystem.

| Tool category | Typical focus | CodeWard focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | Broad open source security posture. | AI-agent readiness at the repository boundary. |
| Secret scanning | Exposed credentials in code or history. | Secret-like values plus unsafe agent, workflow, and script context. |
| MCP security scanners | Deep analysis of MCP servers, tools, prompts, and skills. | Static repo checks without executing untrusted MCP servers. |
| General linters | Code style, correctness, or framework rules. | Guardrails that affect AI-assisted development safety. |

## Roadmap

CodeWard starts as a local CLI and should stay small enough that maintainers can understand every finding.

Near-term priorities:

- finish the [0.2.0 release validation](docs/release-validation.md) checklist across representative manifest, web, mobile, API/service, CLI, monorepo, and test-light repositories
- keep the [release runbook](docs/releasing.md) aligned with the npm package and GitHub Action release process
- publish a versioned GitHub Action release tag after the first public package is ready
- improve branch-aware `review` changed-line locations
- improve generated domain test plans with framework-specific test skeletons
- refine generated Maestro and Playwright drafts with stronger app-specific selector discovery and self-check loops
- expand `eval` into repository-specific verification manifests and taste rubrics
- continue expanding agent surface detection across Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, and related tools
- generate rule documentation from scanner metadata

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for more detail.

## Project Status

CodeWard is early and pre-`1.0`. The public API may change, but the project is intended to stay readable, practical, and useful in real repositories from the first release.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Maintainer permissions stay with IvoryCanvas members, and `main` is protected so external contributors cannot push or merge directly.

Good first contributions include new agent instruction file detectors, better SARIF locations, sample risky repository fixtures, and documentation improvements.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md), and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Philosophy

CodeWard does not replace code review, tests, threat modeling, branch protection, or security review. It is a small preflight check that helps teams notice repo-level AI risks early enough to do something about them.
