# Release Runbook

This runbook defines the release process for `qamap`. It is intentionally conservative: the package should be published only when the local release gate, documentation, and representative repository validation all agree.

## Pre-1.0 Version Policy

QAMap keeps major and minor changes deliberately rare during `0.x` development.

- Patch is the default for bug fixes, inference quality, performance, internal architecture, benchmarks, documentation, and additional adapters that preserve the existing CLI, schema, and safety contracts.
- Minor is reserved for a new product-level capability, an incompatible CLI or manifest contract, or a meaningful change to default execution and safety behavior.
- Risky minor work should ship through `alpha`, `beta`, and `rc` prereleases before the final minor.
- Do not pre-allocate a minor version to every roadmap phase. Define the next minor release bar and continue compatible work as patches until that bar is met.
- Do not schedule `0.5.x` by date or implementation count. Continue `0.4.x` patches until external repository evidence shows that static QA design and automation drafts are dependable enough to support a new execution contract.

Version `0.4.0` is earned by the first commit-to-intent-to-scenario vertical slice: behavior-bearing commits and diff symbols become an evidence-backed lifecycle and concrete runner-independent QA, then existing Playwright, Maestro, or manual adapters compile the result. The next minor remains unscheduled and is reserved for explicit temporary execution and normalized evidence without modifying the target repository. That capability must be proven across unrelated repositories before a `0.5.0` candidate is cut.

Version `1.0.0` requires a stable public contract and external adoption, not implementation volume alone. CLI commands, exit codes, machine output, manifest migration, adapter compatibility, no-LLM/no-upload guarantees, and release operations must be dependable. Repository stars are useful social proof, but repeated use in unrelated repositories and reported QA value are stronger release evidence.

## Release Owner Checklist

Before publishing, confirm:

- `package.json` version matches the intended npm version.
- The canonical release identifier is `vX.Y.Z` (for example, `v0.4.0`). The Git tag and GitHub Release title must match this identifier exactly.
- `CHANGELOG.md` has a dated section for the version being published.
- `README.md`, [adoption](adoption.md), [E2E examples](e2e-output-examples.md), and [release validation](release-validation.md) describe the current CLI behavior.
- `pnpm run release:check` passes from a clean checkout.
- Representative repository smoke notes in [release validation](release-validation.md) do not hit any stop condition.
- npm login is available for a maintainer with publish permission for the `@ivorycanvas/qamap` package.

## Local Release Gate

Run the full local gate:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run release:check
```

The gate must pass:

- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm scan`
- `pnpm bench:ci`
- `git diff --check`
- coverage thresholds for lines, branches, and functions
- `pnpm pack --dry-run`

If the gate fails, fix the product or documentation issue before publishing. Do not publish with a known failing gate.

## Package Preview

Inspect the package contents before publishing:

```sh
pnpm pack --dry-run
npm publish --dry-run --access public
```

The tarball must include runtime output, public documentation, schemas, and package metadata:

- `dist`
- `docs`
- `skills`
- `schema`
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `package.json`

The tarball should not include local run history, generated temporary output, private smoke artifacts, or dependency folders.

## npm Publish

Publish only after the release gate passes and the maintainer confirms npm auth:

```sh
npm whoami
npm publish --access public
```

After publish, verify the public package can be executed without a source checkout:

```sh
VERSION="$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")"
pnpm dlx "@ivorycanvas/qamap@$VERSION" qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD
pnpm dlx "@ivorycanvas/qamap@$VERSION" manifest validate .
pnpm dlx "@ivorycanvas/qamap@$VERSION" e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD --dry-run
```

Use a fresh shell or temporary directory for the smoke check when possible.

## GitHub Release

After npm publish succeeds:

```sh
TAG="v$VERSION"
git tag -a "$TAG" -m "$TAG"
git push origin "$TAG"
```

Create a GitHub Release whose display title is exactly the tag:

```sh
gh release create "$TAG" --title "$TAG" --notes-file <release-notes.md>
```

Do not prefix the title with `QAMap` or `CodeWard`, and do not add a descriptive subtitle. Product positioning and highlights belong in the release notes body so the release list remains consistently sortable as `vX.Y.Z`.

The release notes body should contain:

- a concise release summary
- the current `CHANGELOG.md` section
- the latest local release gate numbers
- a note that the GitHub Action can be pinned to the version tag

## Post-Release Verification

After the tag and GitHub Release are visible, run:

```sh
pnpm dlx "@ivorycanvas/qamap@$VERSION" --version
pnpm dlx "@ivorycanvas/qamap@$VERSION" qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD --format agent
pnpm dlx "@ivorycanvas/qamap@$VERSION" manifest explain . --base origin/main --head HEAD
pnpm dlx "@ivorycanvas/qamap@$VERSION" verify . --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

Then update any public setup examples that should pin to the new `v$VERSION` tag.

## Rollback Notes

If a broken package is published:

- publish a patch version with the fix as soon as possible
- mark the broken npm version deprecated with a short reason
- update the GitHub Release notes to point users to the fixed version

Do not delete public release history unless there is a legal, credential, or severe security reason.
