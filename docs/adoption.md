# Adopting QAMap

QAMap works best when teams treat it as the local QA pass for AI-assisted PRs, not as a replacement for review or security tooling.

## First Run

Start with the PR QA draft on a changed branch — no manifest, no config:

```sh
pnpm dlx qamap qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

For coding agents, request the compact machine-readable summary instead:

```sh
pnpm dlx qamap qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD --format agent
```

When the qa output looks useful, preview and then write the draft E2E files:

```sh
pnpm dlx qamap e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD --dry-run
pnpm dlx qamap e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

For a combined PR verification report with readiness gates, add `verify`:

```sh
pnpm dlx qamap verify . --base origin/main --head HEAD --pr-body-file pr-body.md
```

When developing QAMap itself from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/IvoryCanvas/qamap.git
cd qamap
pnpm install
pnpm build
node dist/cli.js scan /path/to/repo
```

## Build A Verification Base

QAMap works best when the repository becomes the source of truth for verification language, not when every PR starts with a fresh prompt to an external agent.

Start with generated output, then promote only durable knowledge:

- keep generated run history local with `qamap history init .` and `--record-history`
- commit `.qamap/domains.yml` when the team agrees on product/domain names
- commit `.qamap/flows.yml` when the team agrees a journey is important enough to protect repeatedly
- keep draft E2E files reviewable until selectors, fixtures, assertions, and runner config make them real regression coverage

This gives teams a small lifecycle: observe a branch, review the proposed language and flows, promote the stable parts, then let the next branch reuse that context without another LLM call.

## Recommended Rollout

Start advisory, then tighten the gate once the findings are understood.

| Phase | Command | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. PR QA draft | `qamap qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD` | Get the affected flow, suggested E2E/checklist draft, missing evidence, and PR checklist for a branch. |
| 2. Agent handoff | `qamap qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD --format agent` | Give coding agents the same decision content as compact JSON instead of a long report. |
| 3. E2E preview | `qamap e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD --dry-run` | Preview generated draft paths, readiness, action items, and blockers before writing files. |
| 4. E2E apply | `qamap e2e draft . --base origin/main --head HEAD` | Write draft files once the preview looks useful enough to review. |
| 5. QA memory | `qamap manifest init .` (from the default branch) | Create `.qamap/manifest.yaml` so future PR recommendations reuse reviewed team QA language. |
| 6. Verify | `qamap verify . --base origin/main --head HEAD --pr-body-file pr-body.md` | Combine review findings, readiness score, suggested domain tests, and next actions. |
| 7. PR Action | `uses: IvoryCanvas/qamap@main` | Add annotations, a step summary, a test plan, eval, and a sticky PR comment. |
| 8. Guardrail baseline | `qamap scan .` | See repo-level AI agent risks (guardrails layer) without blocking work. |
| 9. High-risk gate | `qamap scan . --fail-on high` | Block obvious risks such as committed env files or unsafe scripts. |
| 10. Medium-risk gate | `qamap scan . --fail-on medium` | Require stronger agent guidance, tests, and workflow permissions. |

`doctor`, `review`, `test-plan`, `eval`, and `report` remain available for teams that want the individual reports behind `verify`.

## Monorepos

When scanning a package inside a larger workspace, pass the workspace root so QAMap can separate package-local risks from repository guardrails:

```sh
qamap doctor services/offer --workspace-root . --format markdown
qamap scan services/offer --workspace-root . --json
```

With `--workspace-root`, QAMap reads package-local files such as `package.json`, `.env.*`, and MCP config from the package path. It reads repo-level guardrails such as `AGENTS.md`, `.github/workflows`, `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` from the workspace root.

## What To Fix First

Fix high-severity findings before letting an agent work broadly in the repo.

1. Remove committed local environment files and rotate any exposed secrets.
2. Move publish, push, merge, and destructive scripts out of normal agent workflows.
3. Remove suspicious instruction text or fence it clearly as an example.
4. Narrow GitHub Actions permissions.
5. Add a real test command that agents and reviewers can run consistently.

## CI Guidance

For early rollout, fail only on high-severity findings:

```yaml
name: QAMap

on:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  qamap:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: IvoryCanvas/qamap@main
        with:
          mode: review
          base: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
          head: HEAD
          fail-on: high
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

When the repository is stable, consider `--fail-on medium`.

For all inputs, see [github-action.md](github-action.md).

## Change Readiness Eval

For the most useful PR-facing report, start with `verify`:

```sh
qamap verify . --base origin/main --head HEAD --pr-body-file pr-body.md --format markdown
```

Use `qamap eval` when an AI-assisted branch looks plausible but reviewers need a faster way to decide what still needs human attention:

```sh
qamap eval . --base origin/main --head HEAD --pr-body-file pr-body.md --format markdown
```

The eval report scores validation commands, changed-test coverage, intent capture, risk explanation, generated domain test scenarios, and review size. A low score does not mean the code is wrong; it means the branch is expensive or risky to verify.

## Interpreting Findings

QAMap findings are meant to be explainable. Each finding includes:

- a rule id such as `QM009`
- severity
- file path when available
- message
- recommendation
- short evidence when safe to print

Prefer severity overrides over broad ignores when a rule is useful but too noisy for a specific repository.

```json
{
  "severity": {
    "QM007": "info"
  }
}
```

Use `ignoreRules` only for findings that the team intentionally accepts.
