# E2E Output Examples

These examples show the shape of CodeWard output that should be good enough for the current public release. They are intentionally short snippets, not full generated files. The important property is that they are derived from repository structure, git changes, manifests, and test evidence without an LLM call.

## PR QA Skill Preview

First contact should work without a manifest:

```sh
pnpm dlx @ivorycanvas/codeward qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

The output should be specific enough to paste into a PR comment:

```txt
# CodeWard QA Draft

Summary
- Project: Web
- Recommended runner: Playwright
- Manifest: not found; using repo signals and PR diff only
- Readiness: near-runnable

PR Comment Draft
- Affected flow: Checkout UI smoke flow
- User journey: Customer -> Open route /checkout -> Complete checkout with realistic form data
- Success signal: confirmation state is visible after submit
- Changed files: src/pages/checkout/index.tsx

Suggested E2E / QA Draft
- tests/e2e/checkout-ui-smoke-flow.spec.ts: near runnable
- Open route /checkout.
- Fill checkout email.
- Submit checkout.
- Assert confirmation state is visible after submit.

Missing evidence before trusting this PR
- [required] fixture: Add deterministic fixture or mock data.
- [recommended] selector: Confirm stable selectors.

PR checklist
- [ ] Review the generated draft path.
- [ ] Answer the reviewer question for the affected flow.
- [ ] Run local validation: pnpm run test:e2e
```

If this recommendation is useful but slightly wrong, the next step is not another long AI prompt. Generate and correct repo-local QA memory:

```sh
pnpm exec codeward manifest init .
```

Then future `codeward qa` runs can use `.codeward/manifest.yaml` to produce more precise flow names, checks, anchors, and repair paths.

## Verification Manifest Feedback

When a repository has `.codeward/manifest.yaml`, CodeWard should explain why a recommendation happened and how a maintainer can correct it:

```txt
Manifest recommendations: 3

Campaign Application Complete `campaign-application-complete`
- Kind: flow
- Confidence: high
- Why this was recommended: Changed files match anchors for the Campaign Application Complete flow.
- Evidence sources: product-qa
- Manifest evidence: .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.campaign-application-complete.anchors
- If this is wrong: update .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.campaign-application-complete.anchors
- Next actions:
  - Draft or review E2E coverage for the Campaign Application Complete flow.
  - Cover the declared checks: Submit content URL successfully; Show validation error for invalid content URL.
- Repair hints:
  - If these files do not belong to this flow, update .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.campaign-application-complete.anchors.
  - If the recommended assertions feel vague, rewrite .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.campaign-application-complete.checks in team language.
```

This is the feedback loop: static analysis proposes a baseline, humans correct durable manifest entries, and future E2E recommendations become more specific without spending another LLM prompt on the same explanation.

`codeward manifest validate .` checks whether that repo-local knowledge is usable:

```txt
CodeWard Manifest Validate
Status: valid
Manifest: .codeward/manifest.yaml
Issues: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 info
```

`codeward manifest explain . --base origin/main --head HEAD` makes a single branch debuggable:

```txt
CodeWard Manifest Explain
Changed files: 1
Matches: 3

Matches:
- Campaign Application Complete (flow, high)
  Why: Changed files match anchors for the Campaign Application Complete flow.
  Evidence: .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.campaign-application-complete.anchors
  If wrong: update .codeward/manifest.yaml > flows.campaign-application-complete.anchors
  Checks: Submit content URL successfully; Show validation error for invalid content URL
```

When that flow includes an entry route and checks, `codeward e2e draft` promotes it ahead of heuristic drafts:

```ts
// Verification manifest evidence:
// - Flow: Campaign Application Complete (campaign-application-complete)
// - Entry route: /campaign/official/applicationComplete
// - Required checks:
//   - [ ] Submit content URL successfully
//   - [ ] Show validation error for invalid content URL

test("Campaign Application Complete", async ({ page }) => {
  await test.step("Open route /campaign/official/applicationComplete.", async () => {
    await page.goto("/campaign/official/applicationComplete");
  });
});
```

## Web Core Flow

When a web app declares a core flow:

```yaml
flows:
  - id: checkout-purchase
    name: Checkout purchase
    priority: critical
    files:
      - src/pages/checkout/**
    routes:
      - /checkout
    checks:
      - Complete checkout with a valid payment method.
      - Verify declined payment recovery.
```

`codeward e2e plan` should prefer the team-approved name:

```txt
Project: Web
Recommended runner: Playwright
Execution profile: high
Start command: pnpm run dev
Test command: pnpm run test:e2e
Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:4173
Matched core flows: 1

Flow: Checkout purchase UI smoke flow
Actor: Customer
Trigger: Open route /checkout.
Success signal: Verify declined payment recovery
```

The Playwright draft should read like the product journey:

```ts
test("Checkout purchase", async ({ page }) => {
  await test.step("Open route /checkout.", async () => {
    await page.goto("/checkout");
  });

  await test.step("Complete checkout with a valid payment method.", async () => {
    await page.getByTestId("checkout-submit").click();
  });
});
```

When CodeWard can infer durable browser controls, the draft should prefer executable Playwright locators over placeholder text:

```ts
await test.step("Fill profile email.", async () => {
  // Step intent: Fill profile email.
  await page.getByPlaceholder("Profile email").fill("codeward@example.com");
});

await test.step("Save settings.", async () => {
  // Step intent: Save settings.
  await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Save settings" }).click();
});
```

The draft result should also explain whether the generated file passed static runner checks:

```txt
Draft self-check: pass
Command: pnpm run test:e2e
Summary: Playwright draft passed static runner checks.
```

Before writing files, `--dry-run` should expose the same readiness data with preview status:

```txt
Mode: dry run (no files were written)
Files: 0 created, 1 previewed, 0 skipped

- preview: `tests/e2e/checkout-purchase.spec.ts` (Checkout purchase)
  - source: core-flow
  - runnable status: near-runnable
  - self-check: pass
```

For framework-native routing, CodeWard should preserve the route a user can actually open rather than framework-only folder syntax. A Next App Router file such as `src/app/(shop)/products/[productId]/page.tsx` should become `/products/:productId`, and a concrete link such as `/products/demo-product` can seed the generated route params:

```ts
const routeParams = {
  productId: "demo-product",
};

await page.goto(`/products/${routeParams.productId}`);
```

React Router config should work similarly when route objects expose path values:

```ts
createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "/reports/:reportId", element: <ReportPage /> },
]);
```

## Expo / React Native Flow

For an Expo or React Native change, CodeWard should recommend Maestro and carry mobile selectors into the draft:

```txt
Project: Expo / React Native
Recommended runner: Maestro

Flow: Ink Drawing UI smoke flow
Actor: User
Trigger: Open the Ink Drawing screen.
Selectors: testID=ink-save-button, testID=record-mode-ink
```

Example Maestro draft shape:

```yaml
appId: ${APP_ID}
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: { id: "record-mode-ink" }
- tapOn: { id: "ink-save-button" }
```

When the changed file name exposes a narrower user action, the generated flow should use that action instead of stopping at a broad domain journey:

```txt
Changed file: src/features/offer/components/ContentUrlSubmitModal.tsx
Domain term: Offer
Generated scenario: Offer Content URL Submit
Generated draft path: .maestro/offer-content-url-submit.yaml
```

The draft should then carry the same product-action wording into the runnable skeleton:

```yaml
# Flow: Offer Content URL Submit
# Domain scenario: Offer Content URL Submit
# Intent: Verify the changed "Content URL Submit" behavior inside Offer instead of stopping at a generic primary journey.
appId: ${APP_ID}
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: { id: "offer-content-url-submit" }
```

## API / Service Contract

For backend changes such as `src/v1/offer/utils.ts`, CodeWard should not invent a browser journey. It should infer the domain word and stay contract-focused:

```txt
Project: API / service
Recommended runner: Manual

Flow: Offer API contract smoke checklist
Actor: API consumer or upstream service
Trigger: Call the endpoint, handler, or service path affected by src/v1/offer/utils.ts.
Success signal: the changed contract returns the expected status, response shape, auth behavior, and failure handling
```

The manual draft should stay actionable:

```md
# Offer API contract

## Steps

- [ ] Call the changed endpoint, client, command, or handler with a valid request.
- [ ] Verify the response shape, status, and parsed data match the public contract.
- [ ] Verify invalid input, authorization failure, timeout, and server-error handling.
- [ ] Check backward compatibility for existing callers.
```

## CLI Command Verification

For an npm package that exposes `package.json` bin entries, CodeWard should not invent a UI journey. It should stay focused on the command contract users run in terminals, scripts, and CI:

```txt
Project: CLI
Recommended runner: Manual

Flow: CLI command verification checklist
Actor: CLI user or maintainer
Trigger: Run the CLI command path affected by src/cli.ts.
Success signal: the command returns the expected stdout, stderr, generated files, and exit code for valid and invalid inputs
```

The manual draft should name concrete command evidence:

```md
# CLI command verification checklist

## Steps

- [ ] Build or install the package in a clean local environment.
- [ ] Run the changed command with a representative valid argument set.
- [ ] Verify stdout, stderr, generated files, and exit code match the intended behavior.
- [ ] Run one invalid, missing-argument, or unsupported-input path and verify the failure message and exit code.
```

## Test-Light Project

When a project has little or no E2E setup, CodeWard should be honest about what must happen before a draft becomes regression coverage:

```txt
## No Test Setup Detected

CodeWard did not find committed test files for this target. Treat this output as a first-test bootstrap plan, not as proof that QA passed.

- Recommended first runner: Playwright
- Setup command: `codeward e2e setup . --runner playwright`
- First bootstrap steps:
  - Create the first changed-flow E2E draft
  - Add stable selectors for changed user actions
  - Add deterministic fixture or mock responses

Bootstrap summary:
4 required bootstrap steps must be resolved before generated E2E drafts should be treated as regression coverage.

Required:
- Configure Playwright before making drafts required
- Create the first changed-flow E2E draft
- Add deterministic fixture or mock responses
- Add stable selectors for changed UI surfaces
```

Draft action items should make the next developer action explicit:

```txt
Action summary:
- readiness score: 64/100 (needs-work)
- runnable status: near-runnable
- self-check: warning or fail when placeholder locators remain
- top blocker: No Playwright config file was detected.
- required runner: Create `playwright.config.ts` with `testDir`, `use.baseURL`, and `webServer.command` when CodeWard inferred the dev URL from scripts.
- required assertion: Turn generated TODOs into runnable assertions
- required fixture: Add deterministic fixture or mock data
- required validation: Resolve missing validation evidence
- recommended manifest: Promote durable product language
```

## API-Dependent Client Flow

When a client-side change calls an API path but the branch does not include backend or fixture evidence, CodeWard should name that as a readiness gap and still give the tester a concrete mock slot:

If reusable repo-local evidence already exists, the PR QA output should point at it instead of only saying "add a fixture":

```txt
Missing evidence before trusting this PR
- [recommended] fixture: Confirm fixture coverage - Reuse or extend existing fixture/mock evidence for this flow: src/services/devSeedService.ts, src/services/reportMockService.ts.
```

```ts
const mockApiResponses = {
  "**/api/orders/fixture-order-id": {
    status: 200,
    body: {
      ok: true,
      source: "codeward-draft",
    },
  },
};

// Replace sample responses with deterministic fixtures from the target domain before promoting this draft.
for (const [urlPattern, response] of Object.entries(mockApiResponses)) {
  await page.route(urlPattern, async (route) => {
    await route.fulfill({
      status: response.status,
      contentType: "application/json",
      body: JSON.stringify(response.body),
    });
  });
}
```

This is useful for PRs where the UI can be built against mockdata before the server implementation is available. The generated file should still report fixture readiness as missing or partial until a reviewer replaces the sample response with domain-correct success, empty, unauthorized, timeout, or server-error fixtures.

## Monorepo Package

When run at the workspace root, CodeWard should identify changed package targets before asking the maintainer to choose a final runner:

```sh
codeward e2e plan . --base main --head HEAD
```

Expected root-level behavior:

```txt
Changed App/Package Targets

| Target | Package | Project | Runner | Scoped Command |
| services/offer | offer | Web | Playwright | codeward e2e plan services/offer --workspace-root . --base main --head HEAD |
| apps/mobile | @acme/mobile | Expo / React Native | Maestro | codeward e2e plan apps/mobile --workspace-root . --base main --head HEAD |
```

For package scans, CodeWard should use workspace policy without leaking workspace-root paths into package-local drafts:

```sh
codeward e2e plan services/offer --workspace-root . --base main --head HEAD
```

Expected behavior:

```txt
Workspace root: .
Package root: services/offer
Matched core flow: Offer submit
Changed files: src/features/offer/submit.ts
Generated draft path: docs/e2e/offer-submit.md
```

The draft should mention package-local files:

```md
Related Changed Files

- `src/features/offer/submit.ts`
```

## What Good Output Feels Like

Good CodeWard output should answer these questions quickly:

- What behavior did this branch probably change?
- What does the team call that behavior?
- Who or what exercises it?
- Which runner or checklist is the right first shape?
- Which setup, selector, fixture, or validation gap blocks this from becoming real regression coverage?

If the output only says "make an E2E test" without these answers, it is not ready for the current release bar.
