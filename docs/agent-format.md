# Agent Format Contract

`qamap qa --format agent` prints one line of JSON (~2–4KB) designed to be pasted into a coding agent's context instead of the full markdown report. This page is the contract for that output: what the fields mean, what an agent may rely on, and how the format is allowed to change.

```sh
qamap qa . --base origin/main --head HEAD --format agent
```

## Stability policy

- The output is a single JSON object on one line, followed by a newline. Nothing else is printed to stdout, and it is never colorized.
- Every payload carries `schema: { "name": "qamap.qa", "version": 1 }`. Check both before parsing the rest.
- Within version 1, fields are **only ever added** — existing fields are never removed, renamed, or retyped. Parse leniently: ignore fields you do not recognize.
- A breaking change bumps `schema.version` to 2. Version 1 output will not silently change shape underneath you.
- The machine-readable definition lives at [`schema/qamap-agent.schema.json`](../schema/qamap-agent.schema.json) and is validated against real output in the test suite.

## Consuming it

The intended loop for a coding agent:

1. Run the command above and parse stdout as JSON.
2. If `readiness.level` is `blocked` or `needs-work`, treat generated drafts as review-only; `requiredBootstrap` lists what unlocks the next stage.
3. Use `flows[].steps` and `flows[].selectors` to write or review tests; `flows[].runnable` says how much to trust the generated draft.
4. Surface `requiredEvidence` in the PR description, and paste `prChecklist` items into the PR body.
5. Run `commands` to validate.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema` | object | `{ name: "qamap.qa", version: 1 }` — check before parsing. |
| `base`, `head` | string | Git refs the diff was computed from. |
| `project` | string | Detected project type (for example `web`, `react-native`, `node`, `unknown`). |
| `runner` | string | Recommended E2E runner: `maestro`, `playwright`, or `manual`. |
| `manifest` | string \| null | Verification manifest path in use, or `null` when the run used repo signals and the PR diff only. |
| `readiness` | object | `score` (0–100) and `level` (`ready` \| `near-runnable` \| `needs-work` \| `blocked`). Human reports render the same value as a four-stage journey; the machine value is stable. |
| `testSuite` | object | `present` (boolean) and `files` (number of detected test files). |
| `firstDraftCommand` | string? | One command that creates the first E2E draft. Present only when the repository has no test suite. |
| `flows` | array | Affected user flows, most relevant first (capped). Each has `title`, `source` (for example `verification-manifest`, `core-flow`), `draft` (generated file path), optional `runnable` (`runnable-candidate` \| `near-runnable` \| `review-only`), optional `entry` (best entrypoint hint), `steps`, and `selectors`. |
| `requiredEvidence` | array | Required-priority QA evidence still missing, capped at 8: `flow`, `kind`, `title`. |
| `recommendedEvidenceCount` | number | How many recommended-priority items were omitted; run without `--format agent` to see them. |
| `requiredBootstrap` | array | Setup steps (capped at 3) that must happen before drafts count as regression coverage: `title`, `action`. |
| `prChecklist` | array of string | Ready-to-paste PR checklist lines (capped). |
| `commands` | array of string | Suggested next commands, most useful first (capped at 4). |

List fields are capped to keep the payload small; caps may grow within version 1 but the shapes above will not change.
