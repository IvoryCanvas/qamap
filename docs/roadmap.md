# Roadmap

CodeWard starts as a local CLI. The project can grow in layers without becoming heavy.

## Near Term

- Config file support for ignored rules and severity overrides.
- More MCP server shape checks.
- GitHub Action wrapper with PR annotations.
- Rule documentation generated from scanner metadata.

## Later

- SARIF output for code scanning integrations.
- VS Code and Cursor extension surfaces.
- Maintainer dashboard for repeated AI-assisted PR risks.
- Policy packs for open source, startup teams, and security-sensitive repositories.

## Non-Goals

- CodeWard will not execute untrusted project code.
- CodeWard will not replace tests, review, branch protection, or security review.
- CodeWard will not become a general-purpose code style linter.
